DOTFILES

## Prerequisite(s)

1. Trust (in the script).

## Setup

```bash
# Follow the prompts in the script.
bash setup.sh
```

## Notes

- Only valid on MacOS. Uses HomeBrew heavily.
- Any new symlinks to be created must be added into `setup.sh`; script is
  hard-coded. No plans to update yet, since it is unlikely that I will have many
  new config files to manage.
- **Not** tested on a clean machine before.
